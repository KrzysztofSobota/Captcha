# Captcha
Client-side captcha

Case-sensitive captcha with one of 2 possible alerts (Okey, wrong) after filling the answer and clicking button. If code doesn't appear, on the right side of its window exist "RESET" button to change code for new one.

TO DO:
Code works, but there are ideas of making some changes in the future (color ribbon which will hide some part of captcha, spelling, etc.).
